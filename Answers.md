1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.  
1A. Server-side routing occurs when the client makes a request and that information is handled by the server which sends back some data to be rendered by the browser. Each time that happens requires a page refresh for the new data to be rendered. Client-side routing differs in that all of the necessary data is served to the client up front, and then React routes take over to dynamically render data and components on that side without the need for any refreshing or additional queries from the server.
